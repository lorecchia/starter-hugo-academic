title: "Uniform Metric Labeling of Perturbation Resilient Instances"
event: Theory Lunch

math: true
subtitle: "[Aravind Reddy](https://aravindreddy.org/), Northwestern University"
summary: "[Aravind Reddy](https://aravindreddy.org/)"
abstract: "Metric labeling is a well-studied generalization of the classic minimum s-t cut problem, which was introduced by Kleinberg and Tardos (JACM 2002). In this talk, we will discuss some recent beyond worst-case analysis results on a popular linear programming formulation of this problem. In particular, we will discuss results on instances which are Perturbation-Resilient. Perturbation-resilience (also known as Bilu-Linial stability) is a popular model for beyond worst-case analysis of approximation algorithms (see [book chapter](https://home.ttic.edu/~yury/papers/bwca.pdf) by Makarychev and Makarychev for an introduction). This talk will be based on a series of works by me and my collaborators (Hunter Lang, Aravindan Vijayaraghavan, and David Sontag) which appeared in AISTATS [2018](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v84/lang18a.html), [2019](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/lang19a.html), and [2021](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/lang21a/lang21a.pdf)."
