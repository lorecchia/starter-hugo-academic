title: "Spectral Graph Theory Without a Spectrum II: Partitioning Hypergraphs via Network Flows"
event: Theory Lunch

math: true
subtitle: "[Antares Chen](https://antaresc.github.io/), University of Chicago"
summary: "[Antares Chen](https://antaresc.github.io/)"
abstract: "Last time, we discussed a non-linear and non-differentiable Laplacian operator for hypergraphs in which aspects of spectral graph theory still generalize to the hypergraph setting. Building on these tools, we discuss a primal-dual approximation algorithm for a specific class of hypergraph partitioning problems called \"minimum ratio-cut\". To do this, we construct a family of local, convex relaxations of the minimum ratio-cut problem, and compose dual solutions using \"cut-matching games\" to certify lower bounds on the minimum ratio-cut objective. This approach leads to the first $O(\\log n)$-approximation for hypergraph sparsest cut that runs in almost-linear time.


Joint work with Konstantinos Ameranis, Lorenzo Orecchia, and Erasmo Tani."
