title: "Low-Stabilizer-Complexity Quantum States Are Not Pseudorandom"
event: Theory Lunch

math: true
subtitle: "[Vishnu Iyer](https://vishnuiyer.org/), University of Texas Austin"
summary: "[Vishnu Iyer](https://vishnuiyer.org/)"
abstract: "We show that quantum states with \"low stabilizer complexity\" can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random. Specifically, given an $n$-qubit pure state $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$, we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes whether $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$ is (i) Haar-random or (ii) a state with stabilizer fidelity at least $\\frac{1}{k}$ (i.e., has fidelity at least $\\frac{1}{k}$ with some stabilizer state), promised that one of these is the case. With black-box access to $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$, our algorithm uses $O \\big( k^{12} \\cdot \\log(1/\\delta) \\big)$ copies of $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$ and $O\\big( nk^{12} \\cdot \\log (1/\\delta) \\big)$ time to succeed with probability at least $1 - \\delta$, and, with access to a state preparation unitary for $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$ (and its inverse), $O\\big( k^{3} \\cdot \\log(1/\\delta) \\big)$ queries and $O(nk^{3} \\cdot \\log(1/ \\delta) \\big)$ time suffice.

As a corollary, we prove that $\\omega\\big( \\log(n) \\big)$ $T$-gates are necessary for any $\\mathsf{Clifford} + T$ circuit to prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states, a first-of-its-kind lower bound."
